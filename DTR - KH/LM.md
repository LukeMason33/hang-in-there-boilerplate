# DTR


#### Project: **Hang in there - Pair Project**

#### Group Member Names: Luke Mason, Kevin Hartmann

#### Goals and Expectations for the Project (What does each group member hope to get out of this project? What do we want to achieve as a team? How will we know that we're successful?):
	
  * Getting comfortable with collaborative work (gitHub, workflow, etc.)
  * Develope a good professional working relationship - 
  * Learn from each other with our different work styles and thought proccess
  * Complete the project and understand what we coded!
  
#### Team strengths & collaboration styles (consider discussing your Pairin qualities here):

**Luke**
1. Open to ideas - There are no bad ideas
2. Active Listener
3. Communicator 
4. Reliable

**Kevin** 
1. Adaptable - Open to constructive criticsm
2. Communication - 
3. Orginization - 
4. Upbeat - if not having fun, whats the point

#### How we can use our strengths to overcome obstacles:

* Using comminucation to work through any obstacles together, and learn together. 
* Using adaptability and being open to ideas, we will be able to build a respectful working realtionship.

#### Schedule Expectations 
_(When are we available to work together and individually? What constraints do we have? Make sure to discuss the remote questions above in regards to this section):_

* Giving ourselves time to debrief from school prior to getting to work
* M - F (4:45p - 8:30p[have the expectation to work until 10PM if we feel we need to])
* Mentor Meetings - K(Mon, 4:15 - 4:45) L(T, 6:00 - 6:30)

* Flexible - Sunday(code free), but do what we need to do - ideally a 4 hour block in AM or PM

#### Communication Expectations:
_(How and often will we communicate? How do we keep lines of communication open? How will we make decisions as a team? How will we communicate about our emotional and mental well-being with each other?):_

* OPEN COMMUNICATION - We are here for each other, and respond pretty fast. Slack, Text!


**Abilities & Growth Expectations (Technical strengths and areas for desired improvement):**

* Git Work Flow - we both have not worked with this and understand we have some learning to do. 
* DRY coding, getting better at simplifying code and not over thinking. 
    * We get stuck - rather than sending code - view the problem from a blank slate

**Workload Expectations (What features do we each want to work on?):**

* Work through iteration 0 (and possibly iteration 1) together, to understand our goals and work load
* Split up the rest of the iterations and get together regularly to review and discuss.
* Keep an open line of communication to get togehter to work through problems/issues
* After project, we will assess where our progress is and adapt a schedule.

**Workflow Expectations (Git workflow/Tools/Code Review/Reviewing Pull Requests/Debugging and Problem-solving Techniques):**

* COMMIT, COMMIT, COMMIT - Commit often and regularly
* REVIEWS - Leave in detail comments on reviews, advice, or suggestions - questions?
* TALK BEFORE PUSH/PULL - communicate actions to avoid confusion -- Never accepting a pull of your own

**Pomodoro Break Schedule:**

* 30 -45 minutes on <--> 5-10 minutes off  ; If we need more, make sure to speak up!

**Expectations for giving and receiving feedback:**

* Constructive Critiscm - Provide reasons, explinations - RESPECTFUL

#### Additional Remote Considerations:

**Project management tools we will use (GitHub projects or Trello are popular tools):**

* Use the GitHub Projects, add assisgnments - update regularly - 
* If it is hard to manage, we can switch to Trello (K - has experience)

### Day 1 Agenda: 

1. Review Interation Objectives - 
2. PsuedoCode - Look through entire: Iteration 0
3. Work through Interation 0 - TOGETHER
4. PsuedoCode - Every interation together before coding - Set the right goals and tasks
5. Look over all other iterations - Set a plan on dividing.conquering!
